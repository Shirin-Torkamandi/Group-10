        <p>On this page, I want to introduce you to the most beautiful cars of this company that reached mass production.</p>

            <li> <h3> bmw Series 5 model E39</h3>
                <p>From 1996 to 2003, one of the most attractive sports sedans in the world was produced by BMW. Narrow headlights with small dual grilles showed an interesting combination of tradition and modernity for the fourth generation 5 Series.
                </p>

            <li>
                <h3>bmw series 6 model E63</h3>
                <P>The second generation of the BMW 6 Series was unveiled 14 years after the end of the production of the first model. The 1990s saw a decline in sales for luxury cars, and expensive Doder models were not profitable.This car, inspired by the shark, continued the design style of the first 6 series.

                <h3>bmw i8</h3>
                <p>Among hybrid cars, BMW i8 is undoubtedly one of the most controversial and special hybrid cars produced in the world, which with its eye-catching design and various modern technologies, after its official introduction in 2013, finally managed to find a way in 2015. The markets have become global and attract the attention of many people.
                    In the cabin, the sense of foreign alienation is reduced to some extent, and it is as if the space inside the cabin belongs to the future a little closer! The steering wheel and digital indicators on the back of the amplifier along with the console leaning towards the driver have everything you need at your fingertips.
                    You may see a lot of foreign cars on the street every day that have an attractive design, but without a doubt, none turn heads as much as the i8. In fact, this handsome German coupe, in addition to its beauty, has a different and unique face, and its shape and image can be considered a revolution in car design, and it created a lot of noise when it was introduced.
