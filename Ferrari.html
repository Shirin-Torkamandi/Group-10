                The first vehicle made with the Ferrari name was the 125 S. Only two of this small two-seat
                sports/racing V12 car were made. In 1949, the 166 Inter was introduced marking the company's significant
                move into the grand touring road car market. The first 166 Inter was a four-seat (2+2) berlinetta coupe
                with body work designed by Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera. Road cars quickly became the bulk of
                Ferrari sales. <br><br>
                The early Ferrari cars typically featured bodywork designed and customised by independent coachbuilders
                such as Pininfarina, Scaglietti, Zagato, Vignale and Bertone. <br><br>
                The original road cars were typically two-seat front-engined V12s. This platform served Ferrari very
                well through the 1950s and 1960s. In 1968 the Dino was introduced as the first two-seat rear mid-engined
                Ferrari. The Dino was produced primarily with a V6 engine, however, a V8 model was also developed. This
                rear mid-engine layout would go on to be used in many Ferraris of the 1980s, 1990s and to the present
                day. Current road cars typically use V8 or V12 engines, with V8 models making up well over half of the
                marque's total production. Historically, Ferrari has also produced flat 12 engines. <br><br>
                For a time, Ferrari built 2+2 versions of its mid-engined V8 cars. Although they looked quite different
                from their 2-seat counterparts, both the GT4 and Mondial were closely related to the 308 GTB. <br><br>
                Ferrari entered the mid-engined 12-cylinder fray with the Berlinetta Boxer in 1973. The later Testarossa
                (also mid-engined 12 cylinders) remains one of the most popular and famous Ferrari road cars of all
                time. <br><br>
                The company has also produced several front-engined 2+2 cars, culminating in the recent V12 model Lusso
                and V8 models Roma, Portofino and Lusso T. The California is credited with initiating the popular
                current model line of V8 front-engined 2+2 grand touring performance sports cars. <br><br>
                Starting in the early 2010s with the LaFerrari, the focus was shifted away from the use of independent
                coach builders to what is now the standard, Ferrari relying on in-house design from the Centro Stile
                Ferrari for the design of all its road cars. <br><br>
